# Mastering-Immutablejs
Mastering Immutable.js by Packt

## Installation
Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed. Then, clone this
repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Immutablejs.git
```

Change directories and install:
```bash
cd Mastering-Immutablejs
npm install
```

## Running examples
Since the code examples use `import`, you need to compile the source before
running it. The easiest way to do this is compiling it on-the-fly using
`babel-node`:
```bash
npm run babel-node 02/01-available-types.js
```

Chapters 14 and 16 have examples that only work in the browser. For these,
you can just open up the HTML files in these directories right in the browser.
